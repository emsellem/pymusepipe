Limitations of run_align recipes
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The esorex implementation of the alignment procedure (implemented in the  :py:func:`pymusepipe.prep_recipes_pipe.PipePrep.run_align_bydataset()`) for multiple object exposures suffers from some severe limitations

    * It does not perform absolute astrometry, but merely fixes the astrometry of subsequent exposures to the WCS of the first one.
    * It works by finding and matching point sources across white light images from multiple exposures. This requires the images to contain a sufficient number of point sources. Moreover, in case of mosaics, is requires the *overlap region* between different MUSE pointings to contain a sufficient number of point sources.
